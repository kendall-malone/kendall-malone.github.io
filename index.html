<p style="text-align:center"><b>History of Rafting</b><br>Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811, when the first recorded trip on the Snake River was planned.  Lack of training, experience, and equipment led to the decision that the river was too dangerous to navigate.  The Snake River was appropriately nicknamed “The Mad River”.  Today, the Class III rapids of the Snake River are popular whitewater runs in Idaho and Wyoming.<br>
    In 1840, the first rubber raft was constructed in order to attempt to survey the Rocky Mountains via the Snake River through the Grand Tetons.  This was a failed attempt the rough waters proved to be too much for the raft and it was destroyed.  It would not be until a hundred years later before we see the reintroduction of the rubber raft. Using surplus military rafts in 1940, we begin to see the emergence of recreational raft trips on the Snake River in northwest Wyoming.</p>
